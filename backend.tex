\section{{\color{blue}Vision}}

\subsection{{\color{blue}Purpose}}

\tab The team's vision for AndOre is a browser centric top down two dimensional MMO. Built to explore machine learning, AndOre requires a robust and dependable server architecture allowing synergistic application of And/Ore’s team at large. Bringing the team's efforts to fruition requires internal efficient implementation and asynchronous communication between the project and the world at large.
 
The team is responsible for developing the tools to analyze aggregated data so frontend can further evolve the user experience. The backend ultimately provides a brick-and-mortar foundation to further the game's development.

\subsection{{\color{blue}Goal}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Implement a communication tool to improve user experience
\item Optimise server performance
\item Improve gameplay through new game mechanics
\end{itemize}

{\large {\color{orange}John Z}}

John has experience in working on all parts of a software project, and has a million different projects he could be working on, but chose to be a founder of And/Ore due to his interests in Machine Learning, as he eventually wants to experiment in combining it with IoT, specially due to the connotations. John also has a tendency to write runoff sentences, and thinks Illeism is silly, but that's just what you do in bios.
